Description: The **kinshipsim** library has been implemented to infer the genetic relationships between 
            pairs of individuals. Following the estimation of the kinship coefficient (theta) and probabilities of sharing 0, 
            1 or 2 alleles  identical-by-descent (Cotterman coefficients, k0, k1, k2), it is necessary to determine the 
            specific ranges for each degree of relatedness as well as kinship relationships. Given this context, this library 
            allows to simulate multiple pedigrees, using both autosomal and X chromosomal data, to study the distribution of 
            the aforementioned parameters across each degree of interest in the attempt to approximate their boundaries.
